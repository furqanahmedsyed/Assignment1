        "append() Method:\n",

        "Ans:- List values and string values in Python share certain similarities, but they also have distinct characteristics. Here are some points highlighting the similarities between lists and strings:\n",
        "Sequential Data:\n",
        "Both lists and strings are sequential data types, meaning they are ordered collections of elements.\n",
        "Indexing:\n",

        "\n",
        "13. Whats the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
        "Ans:- Mutability:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between tuples and lists is mutability. Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify their elements (add, remove, or change elements) after the list is created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, and once a tuple is created, you cannot change its elements.\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "Lists are created using square brackets [], while tuples use parentheses ().\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Lists are generally used when the order and elements can change during the program's execution. They are suitable for scenarios where you need a dynamic, mutable sequence of elements.\n",
        "Performance:\n",
        "Tuples are generally more memory-efficient and have slightly faster access times than lists. If you have a collection of constant values, using a tuple might be more appropriate.\n",

        "\n",
        "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
        "Ans:-To create a tuple containing the integer 42, you would use parentheses () and include the integer within them.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How do you get a list value&#39;s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
        "Ans:- To convert a list to a tuple in Python, you can use the tuple() constructor. Conversely, to convert a tuple to a list, you can use the list() constructor."
