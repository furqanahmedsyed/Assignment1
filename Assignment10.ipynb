        "1. What is the role of try and exception block?\n",
        "Answer:- Try Block: The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the try block. This block is where you anticipate potential errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Except Block: If an exception occurs within the try block, the interpreter immediately jumps to the except block. The except block contains the code that handles the exception gracefully. It allows you to define what actions should be taken in response to specific types of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the syntax for a basic try-except block?\n",
        "Answer:- try:\n",
        "    # Code that may raise an exception\n",
        "    # This is the \"try\" block\n",
        "    # If an exception occurs here, it will be caught by the corresponding except block\n",

        "3. What happens if an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching\n",
        "except block?\n",
        "Answer:- If an exception occurs inside a try block and there is no matching except block to handle that specific type of exception, the program will terminate abruptly, and Python will display a traceback error message.\n",
        "\n",
        "The traceback error message typically includes information about the type of exception that occurred, the line number where the exception occurred, and the sequence of function calls leading up to the exception.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between using a bare except block and specifying a specific\n",
        "exception type?\n",
        "Answer:- Specific Exception Type:\n",
        "When you specify a specific exception type in an except block, you are indicating that you want to catch only that particular type of exception.\n",
        "This allows you to handle different types of exceptions in different ways, providing more precise error handling.\n",
        "Bare Except Block:\n",
        "A bare except block (one without specifying any exception type) catches all exceptions indiscriminately.\n",
        "It will catch any type of exception, including built-in exceptions and user-defined exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Can you have nested try-except blocks in Python? If yes, then give an example.\n",
        "Answer:- Yes, Python allows nesting of try-except blocks. You can have one try block inside another, and each try block can have its own corresponding except block. This is useful for handling exceptions at different levels of granularity within your code."
