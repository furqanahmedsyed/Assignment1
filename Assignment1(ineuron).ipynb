        "Valid: my_variable, total_count\n",
        "Invalid: variable name, amount$\n",
        "Given these rules, eggs is a valid variable name because it starts with a letter, and it contains only letters. On the other hand, 100 is invalid as a variable name because it starts with a number, violating the rule that variable names must start with a letter or underscore.\n",

        "'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos'\n",
        "Ans:- The expression 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' causes an error because you are trying to concatenate a string ('I have eaten') with an integer (99) without explicitly converting the integer to a string first. In Python, you cannot directly concatenate different data types without proper conversion.\n",
        "To fix the error, you need to convert the integer 99 to a string before concatenating it with the other strings. You can do this using the str() function.\n",
        "This will convert the integer 99 to the string '99', and then you can concatenate it with the other strings to form a valid string expression. The str(99) part ensures that you're treating the number as a string during concatenation."
